# Song of the Day 2025

An ongoing analysis on my "Songs of the Day" playlist for 2025. This project is ongoing and linked to Spotify with their developer API.

This idea comes from my love of data and music. I am a big fan of ***Spotify Wrapped***, but I find that it doesn't always capture the progress of my listening over the course of the full year. 

You can find the full playlist [here](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3fLkNQ6NOkQOQRj8Wu9jKI?si=12136c30b7e141ea)!
